I'm **Omid Sardari**.

I live in **Ottawa, Canada**, where I work as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer and run **[Memory Bridge](https://memorybridgeai.com)**.

### Two Rhythms

My life splits into two modes.

There's the digital one: building AI systems, architecting memory layers, staring at loss curves. I spend my days solving a specific problem—how to give AI agents persistent memory without surrendering user privacy. It's technical work, and I love it.

Then there's the physical one. Winter means skiing and skating. Summer means trails and water. I'm not an extreme athlete; I just need regular contact with things that are real. In an era where content is infinite and increasingly synthetic, the physical world is the only thing that cannot be hallucinated.

I find that the best engineering thinking happens somewhere between these two modes—usually when I'm too tired to overthink.

### What I'm Building

**[Memory Bridge](https://memorybridgeai.com)** fixes the amnesia problem in AI. Right now, every conversation with an LLM starts from zero. I'm building the infrastructure to change that—privacy-first, provider-agnostic, economically viable at scale.

### What I'm Writing

I'm working on a series called **The Uniqueness Economy**—exploring what happens to human value when the thing that made you special becomes a commodity. This blog is where I think out loud about the intersection of AI, work, and what it means to stay human in an algorithmic world.
