# Creating Your First Post - Template

## üìù Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Create the Post File
**File Location**: `_posts/`
**File Name**: `YYYY-MM-DD-your-post-title.md`
**Example**: `2024-12-07-my-first-zero-shot-thought.md`

### 2. Copy This Template

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "My First Zero-Shot Thought"
subtitle: "Welcome to my ML and tech journey"
date: 2024-12-07 15:30:00
tags: [introduction, machine-learning, personal]
comments: true

Welcome to **Zero-Shot Thoughts** ‚Äì where I share my insights on machine learning, technology, and the fascinating world of AI.

## What You'll Find Here

As an ML Engineer and MLOps Specialist, I'll be writing about:

- **Machine Learning Insights** - From model training to production deployment
- **MLOps Best Practices** - Tools, techniques, and lessons learned
- **Technical Deep-Dives** - Exploring algorithms, frameworks, and methodologies
- **Industry Observations** - Trends and developments in AI/ML space
- **Personal Projects** - Sharing my experiments and discoveries

## Why "Zero-Shot Thoughts"?

The name reflects the nature of learning and thinking in our field ‚Äì sometimes the best insights come without prior examples, just like zero-shot learning in ML. These are my unfiltered thoughts and experiences in the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence.

## What's Coming Next

I'm excited to share posts about:
- Fine-tuning large language models
- Building robust ML pipelines
- Exploring the latest in generative AI
- Practical MLOps strategies
- Real-world AI applications

Thanks for joining me on this journey! üöÄ

## üîÑ Complete Workflow for Every Future Post

### A. Writing Process
1. **Plan your post** - Outline key points, target audience, main message
2. **Write in Obsidian** (or any markdown editor) using standard markdown
3. **Include code examples** with proper syntax highlighting
4. **Add relevant tags** that categorize your content

### B. Publishing Process

1. **Create file** in `_posts/` with format: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-title.md`

2. **Add front matter** (replace with your details):
```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Descriptive Title"
subtitle: "Brief description of the post"
date: 2024-12-07 10:00:00
tags: [machine-learning, python, tutorial]
comments: true
author: Omid Sar
---
```

3. **Add your content** below the front matter

4. **Preview locally** (optional but recommended):
```bash
docker compose up
# Visit http://localhost:4000 to preview
```

5. **Publish to live site**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add post: [Your Post Title]"
git push origin main
```

### C. Content Best Practices

**File Naming**:
- ‚úÖ `2024-12-07-understanding-transformers.md`
- ‚úÖ `2024-12-08-mlops-with-docker.md`
- ‚ùå `my post.md`
- ‚ùå `understanding transformers.md`

**Tags Examples**:
- Technical: `[machine-learning, deep-learning, python, pytorch]`
- Project: `[project, nlp, sentiment-analysis, deployment]`
- Tutorial: `[tutorial, beginner, step-by-step, hands-on]`
- Personal: `[thoughts, career, industry, insights]`

**Title Guidelines**:
- Be descriptive and specific
- Include key terms your audience searches for
- Keep under 60 characters for good SEO
- Use title case

### D. Common Content Types for Your Blog

**Technical Tutorials**:
```markdown
---
title: "Fine-tuning BERT for Sentiment Analysis: A Complete Guide"
tags: [tutorial, bert, nlp, sentiment-analysis, pytorch]
---
```

**Project Showcases**:
```markdown
---
title: "Building an End-to-End MLOps Pipeline for Text Classification"
tags: [project, mlops, pipeline, aws, docker, monitoring]
---
```

**Industry Insights**:
```markdown
---
title: "The State of Large Language Models in 2024"
tags: [llm, industry, analysis, gpt, trends]
---
```

**Learning Notes**:
```markdown
---
title: "Key Takeaways from the ICLR 2024 Conference"
tags: [conference, research, deep-learning, insights]
---
```
